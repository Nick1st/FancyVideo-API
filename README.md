# vlcj-mod
A minecraft mod for playing videos on GUIs

Plugins in run/plugins are required for libvlc to launch and/or needed to play videos (e.g. Source access, codex, chromas, ...).
Plugins in run/plugins unused are not used currently.

Transforms (scalling, mirroring, rotating, ...) should be done using native calls (to get best performance possible).
